**Total Pervasive Ambient Computing for Vehicle Operator Training**

toc::[]

== What This Is

Candy Crash is a framework for training humans to operate vehicles—cars, motorbikes, aircraft, watercraft—through *pervasive ambient computing*.

This is not an LMS. This is not e-learning. This is not a course.

This is an *environmental intervention* that makes the boundaries between "training" and "living" dissolve.

== The Philosophical Foundation

=== The Problem with Traditional Training

Traditional vehicle operator training commits a fundamental error: it treats operation as a *skill to be acquired* rather than a *way of being to be inhabited*.

You sit in a classroom. You read theory. You take a test. Then, separately, you sit in a vehicle and practice. The assumption: knowledge transfers cleanly from abstraction to embodiment.

This is wrong.

=== Embodied Cognition and Situated Learning

Cognition does not happen in the head. It happens in the dynamic coupling between organism and environment. When you drive, you do not "apply knowledge"—you *perceive-act* in a continuous loop with the vehicle and the road.

The steering wheel is not a tool you use. It becomes part of your body schema. The car's boundaries become your boundaries. You do not think "turn the wheel 15 degrees"; you *flow through the curve*.

This cannot be taught through abstraction. It must be *grown* through sustained environmental coupling.

=== The Ambient Computing Thesis

Mark Weiser wrote: "The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it."

We apply this to training: *The most profound training is that which disappears. It weaves itself into the fabric of everyday life until learning and living are indistinguishable.*

The trainee does not "study driving." The trainee *lives in an environment that continuously cultivates vehicular perception-action competence*.

== What Total Pervasive Ambient Training Means

=== Dissolution of the Training Boundary

There is no "lesson time" and "non-lesson time." Every moment is potentially a training moment:

* Walking down a street → the trainee perceives traffic patterns, timing, gaps
* Riding as a passenger → the trainee feels acceleration, braking, cornering forces
* Sleeping → consolidation of procedural memory continues
* Cooking → proprioceptive calibration continues in the background
* Sitting idle → micro-simulations present themselves

The training is *always on*, but it is not intrusive. It is *ambient*—present in the environment, available when attention is available, receding when it is not.

=== Multi-Modal Environmental Saturation

Ambient training operates across all sensory channels and all contexts:

**Haptic Layer**::
Wearable devices that provide subtle force-feedback. Feel steering resistance while walking. Feel braking pressure while sitting. The hands and feet develop procedural memory continuously.

**Audio Layer**::
Spatial audio that trains situational awareness. Engine sounds. Tire sounds. Traffic patterns. Not as "lessons" but as environmental texture—present, informative, unobtrusive.

**Visual Layer**::
Augmented reality that overlays driving-relevant perception onto everyday scenes. Traffic flow visualization. Gap timing. Hazard prediction zones. Not replacing reality but *annotating* it.

**Proprioceptive Layer**::
Body-position awareness training. Vehicle operators must know where their body is in space. Ambient systems that occasionally prompt body-awareness micro-exercises.

**Temporal Layer**::
Learning must respect biological rhythms. Systems that detect alertness, receptivity, consolidation states. Training intensifies when the brain is receptive. Training recedes when the brain needs rest or consolidation.

=== The Vehicle as Extended Phenotype

The goal is not "learning to drive." The goal is *becoming a vehicle operator*—a human whose cognitive boundaries have extended to include the machine.

This requires:

1. **Perceptual Recalibration**: The trainee must perceive the vehicle's dimensions as their own dimensions
2. **Procedural Embodiment**: Control inputs must become as automatic as walking
3. **Predictive Integration**: The trainee must feel what the vehicle will do before it does it
4. **Environmental Coupling**: The trainee must perceive the road-vehicle system as a unified dynamic field

None of this can be "taught." It must be *grown* through extended environmental exposure.

== Architecture Principles

=== Sensor Mesh

The system requires a mesh of sensors across the trainee's environment:

* Wearables (hands, feet, torso)
* Environmental sensors (home, transit, workplace)
* Vehicle integration (when operating or riding)
* Biometric monitoring (alertness, stress, receptivity)

These sensors do not merely collect data. They *create an extended nervous system* that allows the training system to perceive the trainee's state and context.

=== Actuator Mesh

The system requires actuators that can modulate the trainee's environment:

* Haptic feedback devices
* Spatial audio systems
* AR displays / smart glasses
* Environmental lighting and sound
* Vehicle integration systems

These actuators do not merely "present lessons." They *modulate the environment* to create learning-optimal conditions.

=== The Training Intelligence

At the center: an intelligence that:

* Perceives the trainee's current state (biometric, contextual, historical)
* Models the trainee's current competence landscape
* Identifies optimal micro-interventions
* Delivers those interventions through the actuator mesh
* Observes results and updates the competence model

This is not "adaptive learning" in the LMS sense. This is *continuous environmental modulation* in service of competence development.

=== Privacy and Sovereignty

Total ambient computing raises profound privacy questions. The trainee must remain *sovereign*:

* All data remains under trainee control
* Training can be paused, modified, or terminated at will
* No data leaves the trainee's personal compute environment without explicit consent
* The system serves the trainee; the trainee does not serve the system

== Vehicle Domains

The framework is domain-agnostic but implementation is domain-specific:

=== Ground Vehicles (Cars, Trucks)

Focus areas:
* Traffic flow perception
* Gap judgment
* Speed-distance calibration
* Mirror-signal-maneuver proceduralization
* Hazard prediction
* Low-grip handling intuition

=== Two-Wheeled Vehicles (Motorbikes, Bicycles)

Focus areas:
* Balance and countersteering intuition
* Lean angle perception
* Road surface reading
* Visibility and conspicuity awareness
* Target fixation prevention
* Emergency braking procedure

=== Aircraft

Focus areas:
* Three-dimensional spatial orientation
* Instrument scan patterns
* Procedure memorization and chunking
* Decision-making under uncertainty
* Physiological state management
* Multi-crew coordination patterns

=== Watercraft

Focus areas:
* Momentum and inertia intuition
* Weather and water reading
* Navigation pattern development
* Emergency procedure embodiment
* Communication protocol proceduralization

== What Must Be Built

=== Phase 0: Conceptual Foundation

Before any code is written:

* Define the competence model for each vehicle domain
* Map the perception-action loops that constitute skilled operation
* Identify the micro-skills that can be trained ambiently
* Design the sensor/actuator requirements
* Establish privacy architecture
* Create the ethical framework

=== Phase 1: Core Intelligence

* Trainee state perception system
* Competence modeling framework
* Intervention planning engine
* Outcome observation system
* Model update loop

=== Phase 2: Sensor Integration

* Wearable device protocols
* Environmental sensor protocols
* Vehicle integration protocols
* Biometric monitoring integration
* Context inference engine

=== Phase 3: Actuator Integration

* Haptic feedback protocols
* Spatial audio rendering
* AR overlay system
* Environmental modulation protocols
* Vehicle integration for active training

=== Phase 4: Domain-Specific Training Modules

For each vehicle domain:
* Competence decomposition
* Micro-intervention library
* Assessment methodology
* Progression modeling

=== Phase 5: Validation

* Effectiveness studies
* Safety validation
* Long-term outcome tracking
* Ethical review

== Current State

The repository currently contains remnants of an earlier approach—a conventional LMS for driving theory. This approach was fundamentally misguided.

The existing Rails application, database schema, and quiz engine represent the *wrong paradigm*. They assume training is "content delivery" rather than "environmental cultivation."

This must be rebuilt from first principles.

== Technology Direction

Given the RSR compliance requirements and the nature of the system:

**Core Runtime**: Rust
* Systems-level performance for real-time sensor/actuator loops
* Memory safety for safety-critical systems
* Embedded deployment capability

**User Interfaces**: ReScript
* Type-safe web interfaces for configuration and monitoring
* Compilation to efficient JavaScript
* Functional paradigm matches the declarative nature of UI

**Formal Verification**: SPARK/Ada
* Safety-critical components require formal verification
* Proof of absence of runtime errors
* Required for aviation and medical-adjacent systems

**ML/Inference**: Rust with WASM
* Competence modeling and intervention planning
* Must run on-device for privacy
* WASM for portable deployment

== The Name

"Candy Crash" is intentional provocation.

The name evokes the dopamine-driven, attention-capturing design of mobile games. This system takes that same environmental-saturation approach but redirects it toward genuine human capability development.

Instead of capturing attention to extract value, we saturate the environment to cultivate competence.

The crash is what we prevent.

== License

GPL-3.0-or-later

The system that trains humans to operate vehicles must remain free. No entity should be able to enclose and privatize the cultivation of human capability.
